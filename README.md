Analysis of Prosper Loan Data

# Loan Data Exploration
## by Awurigwe Joseph


## Dataset

The dataset (Prosper Loan Data) comprised of borrower APRs and attributes of 113,937 loans. The attributes included original loan amount, borrower's Prosper rating, loan length, borrower's reported monthly income, as well as many additional features such as borrower's employment status, debt to income ratio, current loan status etc.



## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, I noticed that the borrower APR is inversely connected with original loan amount. At varied size of the loan amount, the APR has a huge range, however the range of APR reduce with the increase of loan amount. The borrower APR likewise decreases with the gradually better rating. Borrowers with the top Prosper ratings enjoy the lowest APR. It means that the Prosper rating has a considerable effect on borrower APR. Interestingly, the link between borrower APR and loan amount shifts from negative to somewhat positive when the Prosper ratings are upgraded from HR to A or better. This is may because people with A or AA ratings tend to borrow more money, increasting APR could prevent them borrow even more and maximize the profit. But consumers with lower ratings tend to borrow less money, cutting APR could encourage them to borrow more. I also found that the borrower APR drop with the increasing of borrow term for those having HR-C raings. But for persons with B-AA scores, the APR grow with the increase of borrow duration.

Outside of the primary determinants of interest, I observed that the loan amount is strongly connected with the declared monthly income, it makes sense since borrowers with larger monthly income might loan more money. The loan amount is also raised with the extension of loan term. I also noticed that borrowers with better ratings have larger monthly income and loan amount. Employed, self-working and full time borrowers have larger monthly income and loan amount than part-time, retired and not employed borrowers. There is an interaction between category term and Prosper rating features. Proportionally, there are more 60 month loans on B and C grades. There is only 36 months loans for HR rating borrowers. For loan amount, there is an interaction between term and rating. With better Prosper rating, the loan amount of all three terms increases, the increase amplitude of loan amount between terms also becomes larger.

## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I solely focusedÂ on features that could effect the borrower APR, which are original loan amount, Prosper rating. I started by demonstrating the distribution of borrower APR and loan amount variable. Then, I illustrated the relationship between APR vs. loan amount, as well as APR vs. rating. I also explored the influence of rating on ralationship between APR and loan amount, as well as the effect of rating on relationship between borrower APR and term.
